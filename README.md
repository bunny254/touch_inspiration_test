# touch_inspiration_test
Interview test on my JavaScript(React.js) knowledge.
For this Web App I have used the npm package manager for JavaScript.
For the File Arrangement/Structure, the parent folder is 'touchInterview' then inside it 'client' folder which houses my react application.
GETTING STARTED: Use your preffered cloning method from github. Then delete the package-lock.json. Cd into your directory with the contents for this app. Then cd client and run npm install.
Start the application.
App Components are in the Components folder which get passed to the app.js component then to the router component which handles the routing for the application.
Thank You!
